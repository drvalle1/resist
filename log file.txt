Why do we see no variability after some iterations for some betas?

The problem lies with the occupied groups, rather than the unoccupied groups. Because we only adapt after 100, the model might be stuck with a parameter that doesn't move because it is stuck using a bad jump parameter for a long time.

Another problem is that the algorithm is actively eliminating groups during these initial iterations where parameters are stuck at bad values.

Proposed solutions:
- start with jump1=0.1 instead of jump1=1
- update more frequently: after every 50 instead of every 100

There was a huge bug in how I proposed new values (i.e., betas.prop)!
